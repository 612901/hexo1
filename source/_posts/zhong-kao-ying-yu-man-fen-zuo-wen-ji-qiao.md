如何写好中考作文

那么，如何写好中考作文？阅卷老师喜欢什么样的作文呢？

结合近几年的中考作文的评分标准以及阅卷经验，给同学们总结了作文拿高分的技巧，供大家参考。

一、结构要清晰

结构清晰这点真的很重要，我们都知道，阅卷老师们要在规定的时间内批阅上千份作文，而清晰的结构，会让阅卷老师一目了然，自然就会喜欢你的作文。

什么结构好呢？那就是三段式。

第一段要开门见山，直接拿出主题。给大家举个例子，比如，写我的妈妈，第一段直接就说 My mother is a worker. She is beautiful and she is a good mother. 明确自己的观点。

第二段就要说，她为什么是一个好妈妈。1. She works hard. 2. She is very strict with me. 3. She always encourages me and help me when I am in trouble. 详细说出妈妈的优点。

第三段得出结论。大家可以发表自己的观点，也可以提出建议和希望。如，I love my mother. I love my family！

二、时态要准确

英语作文除了结构，还有一个是阅卷老师最敏感的，那就是时态，这也是一篇作文是否得高分的关键。要明确文章的时态、同时人称要一致、数要一致、首尾要呼应。再根据内容要求，现确定事情是过去已经发生还是未来即将发生，比如记叙一件事要用一般过去时；写经常发生的事或对人物的描写，要用一般现在时；对于未来的憧憬要用一般将来时；过去的事情对现在造成的影响或过去延续到现在的状况都用现在完成时。一定不能乱用乱配。

三、短语运用要灵活

同学们在写作文的时候，要尽量使用有把握的词，避免不必要的失分。当然，定语从句、宾语从句等句型，在关键的时候用上一两个，会增添你文章的文采。在英语中存在很多简单又能表达很多意思的短语。这些短语的运用可以使作文更加原汁原味。

还有对关联词的使用，如first of all，secondly，finally，last，so that，in order that，not...but，not only...but also等。还可以使用高级点的如，in a word，all in all （表示总结的），but，yet，however（表示转折）等。

经验的阅卷老师很在意这些逻辑连接词，因为这些词体现了整个文章的思路。

四、写全要点

近年的各地中考英语提示性作文比较多，也就是说写作内容几乎都有要点提示，确切地说就是给出写作提纲，通常都是3 ～ 5个提示点，这种作文，同学们一定记住不要逐字翻译，但是提示点必须在文章中有所体现。文章写得再好，如果缺少了要点就会扣分的。所以要点也就是文章的第二段内容，同学们要把提示点写全，然后围绕提示点充分发挥，丰富自己所写的内容。

五、书写要认真

这一点同学们必须高度重视，作文的书写一定要保持规范整洁，同一篇文章书写规范整洁的和书写混乱的之间可以有2到5分的差距。

给阅卷老师留下最深刻印象的就是你的书写，最简单的得分点就是我们的认真书写。工整漂亮的书写会给评卷老师留下美好的第一印象和愉快的心情，在扣分时自然会“手下留情”。

大家切记不要涂改，在情况允许的前提下可以打些草稿。避免不必要的丢分。

漂亮的字体是可以练出来的，只要大家在心里注意了自己的书写，都会写得很好。
